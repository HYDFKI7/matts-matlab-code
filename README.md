## cps.m
### Composite-plus-scale climate reconstruction, plus basic skill metrics
#### Inputs:
  * y: Climate time-series, filled with NaNs for years to reconstruct
  * X: Proxy array (same number of rows as y), with each column representing a proxy series
#### Outputs:
  * yhat: proxy-reconstructed climate time-series
  * r2: R<sup>2</sup> of proxy composite vs. climate during instrumental period
  * stats: structure with Pearson correlation, *p*-value, variance scaled R<sup>2</sup> (McCarroll et al. 2015), and RMSE

## evc.m
### Calculate Extreme Value Capture statistic of scaled reconstruction (McCarroll et al. 2015)
#### Inputs (all vectors of the same length):
  * obs: observed climate time-series
  * est: estimated climate time-series during instrumental period
  * years: years corresponding to obs and est vectors
#### Outputs:
  * p_tot: *p*-value of TOTAL EVC (i.e., both low and high extremes)
  * p_low: *p*-value of low EVC
  * p_high: *p*-value of high EVC
  * pct_tot: percentage of extremes (both high and low) captured by reconstruction
  * pct_low: percentage of low extremes captured by reconstruction
  * pct_high: percentage of high extremes captured by reconstruction

## extremeResponse.m
### Calculate percentage of extreme low/high precipitation years that were also extreme low/high growth years
#### Inputs:
  * trw: tree-ring series
  * clim: climate time-series
  * extremeThresh: threshold for defining extreme values (default: upper & lower 10th percentiles)
#### Outputs:
  * extremePct: two-element vector with percentage of low and high climate extremes that were also low and high growth extremes
  * p: two-element vector with *p*-value (from binomial distribution) for two-tailed hypothesis test that observed extreme response was from chance agreement

## fao_pm.m
### Calculate potential evapotranspiration of reference crop using FAO Penman-Monteith method (Allen et al. 1998)
#### Inputs:
  * tmax: average daily maximum temperature (deg C) [12 x number of years]
  * tmin: average daily minimum temperature (deg C) [12 x number of years]
  * tdmean: average daily dewpoint temperature (deg C) [12 x number of years]
  * lat: latitude (decimal degrees)
  * alt: elevation above sea level (m)
  * coast: 0 (not coast) or 1 (coast)
#### Outputs:
  * pet: monthly potential evapotranspiration (mm) [12 x number of years]
  * Rn: monthly net radiation (W m<sup>2</sup> ???) [12 x number of years]
  * vpd: monthly mean vapor pressure deficit (kPa) [12 x number of years]
  * G: monthly ground heat flux (W m<sup>2</sup> ???) [12 x number of years]
  * Rs: monthly incident solar radiation (W m<sup>2</sup> ???) [12 x number of years]

## fdr.m
### Control the false discovery rate in multiple hypothesis testing and conduct field significance test (Wilks 2006, 2016)
#### Inputs:
  * ps: vector of _p_-values from multiple hypothesis tests
  * q: global significance level (default: *q*=0.05)
#### Outputs:
  * test: significance of "field" at alpha=*q* (0: not significant; 1: significant)
  * pfdr: *p*-value for local significance tests controlling false discovery rate at alpha=*q*

## lmInteractionCV.m
### Compare predictions from additive vs. interaction multiple regression models using cross-validation
#### Inputs:
  * y: response variable
  * x1: predictor variable #1
  * x2: predictor variable #2
#### Outputs:
  * h: test of interaction importance (0: not important interaction, 1: important interaction)
  * S: structure of additive & interaction models + statistics (RMSE, Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency, R<sup>2</sup>, *p*-value, effect sizes)

## make_cmap.m
### Linearly interpolate MATLAB rgb colormap to *n* levels
#### Inputs:
  * c: [n x 3] array of RGB "endmember" values to interpolate between
  * n: number of desired levels in the colormap
#### Outputs:
  * cn: updated colormap with *n* levels
